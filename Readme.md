## Why Customer Churn Prediction?

Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses, directly impacting revenue and profitability. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making it essential to understand the drivers of churn. This project uses a dataset that provides insights into customer demographics, usage behavior, subscription details, and engagement levels. By leveraging this data, businesses can:

- Identify at-risk customers.
- Enhance retention strategies.
- Foster long-term customer loyalty.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is designed to help identify and analyze factors contributing to customer churn. Below is a description of the key features:

1. **Age:** The age of the customer.
2. **Gender:** The gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
3. **Usage Frequency:** The frequency with which the customer uses the service.
4. **Support Calls:** The number of support calls made by the customer.
5. **Payment Delay:** The number of days the customer delayed payment.
6. **Subscription Type:** The type of subscription plan the customer is on (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
7. **Contract Length:** The duration of the subscription contract (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).
8. **Total Spend:** The total amount spent by the customer during their tenure.
9. **Last Interaction:** The number of days since the customerâ€™s last interaction with the service.
10. **Churn:** A binary variable indicating if the customer has churned (1 for churn, 0 for retention).
11. **Tenure Group:** The tenure of the customer, categorized into ranges (e.g., 1â€“12 months, 25â€“36 months).

## Key Features

### 1. **Data Workflow**
   - **Data Handling:** Comprehensive CSV datasets with demographic, behavioral, and subscription details.
   - **EDA & Preprocessing:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applied robust preprocessing techniques to clean and standardize the data.
   - **Modeling:** Built and trained machine learning models using **MLflow** for experiment tracking and hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. **Version Control**
   - Managed datasets, pipelines, and models with **DVC (Data Version Control)** for reproducibility and traceability.

### 3. **Application Development**
   - Developed a **FastAPI backend** to expose the churn prediction functionality as an API.
   - Built a user-friendly **Streamlit frontend** for intuitive interaction.

### 4. **Testing**
   - Employed **Deepchecks** to validate data quality and model performance.

### 5. **Deployment**
   - Deployed on **Render** with Dockerized services for reliability and scalability.

### 6. **CI/CD Automation**
   - Automated build, test, and deploy processes using **Jenkins**.

### 7. **Monitoring**
   - Integrated **Arize** for end-to-end monitoring of model performance and data drift detection.
